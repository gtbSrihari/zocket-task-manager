# Zocket Task Manager (Frontend)

A real-time task management system frontend built for the Zocket Full-Stack Rapid Development Challenge in 4 hours (split over Feb 20-21, 2025, due to late start). This project focuses solely on the frontend, mocking backend features due to time constraints.

## Features
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Task Dashboard**: Displays "Complete the Zocket frontend assignment and submit - Pending" with mocked real-time updates (WebSocket via `socket.io-client`)
- **Authentication**: Client-side JWT handling (mocked token on login)
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Mocked task suggestions (simulating OpenAI/Gemini API)
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel
